# ArrayDemo

This program stores an array of these 10 integers. int numbers = (7, 6, 3, 2, 10, 8, 4, 5, 9, 1)

Until the user enters a sentinel value, allows the user four options:
(1) to view the list in order from the first to last position in the stored array
(2) to view the list in order from the last to first position (without permanently changing in order of the array)
(3) to choose a specific position to view
(4) to quit the application.
