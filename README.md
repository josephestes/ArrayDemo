### Program Logic

- Store an array of these 10 integers: (7, 6, 3, 2, 10, 8, 4, 5, 9, 1)
- Until the user enters a sentinel value, allow the user four options:
  1. View the list in order from the first to last position in the stored array
  2. View the list in order from the last to first position (without permanently changing in order of the array)
  3. Choose a specific position to view
  4. Quit the application
