# ArrayDemo

This program displays the contents of an array per the user's choice.

### Program Logic

- Store an array of these 10 integers: (7, 6, 3, 2, 10, 8, 4, 5, 9, 1)
- Until the user enters a sentinel value, allow the user four options:
  - View the list in order from the first to last position in the stored array
  - View the list in order from the last to first position (without permanently changing in order of the array)
  - Choose a specific position to view
  - Quit the application
